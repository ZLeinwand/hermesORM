# HermesORM


## Introduction
Hermes Object Relational Mapping is a framework connecting classes to relational database tables to allow minimal setup time by using a preconfigured base class and metaprogramming techniques to quickly set up important functionality by mapping a subclass to existing tables. These are commonly known as Models, or the M in MVC. Not only do the models have their own functions to make common queries to the database, models can also be connected to other models through associations. HermesORM relies heavily on specific naming conventions, so while mappings can be defined, it's recommended to follow the predifined patterns.
